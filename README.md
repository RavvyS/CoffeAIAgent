## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup Environment

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir coffee-shop-ai
cd coffee-shop-ai

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv coffee_ai_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
coffee_ai_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source coffee_ai_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Required Settings:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- `WEATHER_API_KEY` - Get from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (optional)
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis Cloud connection string (or use local Redis)

### 4. Setup Redis (Choose One Option)

**Option A: Redis Cloud (Recommended)**
1. Sign up at [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/try-free/)
2. Create a free database
3. Copy connection URL to `REDIS_URL` in `.env`

**Option B: Local Redis**
```bash
# Install Redis locally
# On macOS:
brew install redis
redis-server

# On Ubuntu:
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 6. Test Your Setup

1. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. You should see the chat interface
3. Try sending a message: "Hello, I'd like to see your menu"
4. The AI should respond with menu information

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Connection Status Check
- **Green dot**: Everything connected ✅
- **Yellow dot**: Connecting/reconnecting 🔄
- **Red dot**: Connection failed ❌

### Test Conversations
Try these test messages:
```
- "What's good today?"
- "I'm feeling stressed, what do you recommend?"
- "Show me hot drinks under $5"
- "I'm lactose intolerant, what options do I have?"
```

### API Health Check
Visit: http://localhost:8000/health

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
